# Module cryptography-provider-jdk

Provides implementation of [CryptographyProvider][CryptographyProvider] via JDK built-in [JCA][JCA]

For supported targets and algorithms, please consult [Supported primitives section][Supported primitives section]

## Limitations

* ECDSA: only `DER` signature format is supported for java < 9
* KeyFormat: doesn't support `JWK` key format yet

## Custom Java providers

Some specific algorithms (SHA3 family of digests on JDK 8) or parameters (`secp256k1` curve for ECDSA) could be not supported by default JDK
provider, but it doesn't mean, that you can not use them with `cryptography-kotlin`.
There is a possibility to create [CryptographyProvider][CryptographyProvider]
from [java.util.Provider](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/security/Provider.html), f.e.
using [BouncyCastle](https://www.bouncycastle.org):

```kotlin
val provider = CryptographyProvider.JDK(BouncyCastleProvider())

// get some algorithm which not supported on a JDK version or platform (in case of Android)
provider.get(SHA512)
```

## Android support

JDK provider is also tested via Android emulator on API level 21, 27 and 30.
Supported algorithms on Android highly depend on Android API level and used provider.
Some limitations are:

* PEM support requires Android API level with Java 8 support because of dependency on `java.util.Base64`
* default provider doesn't support `RSA-SSA-PSS` or `SHA3` algorithms

For better compatibility, you can use [BouncyCastle](https://www.bouncycastle.org) provider as shown
in [Custom Java providers](#custom-java-providers).

## Example

```kotlin
val provider = CryptographyProvider.JDK // or CryptographyProvider.Default

// get some algorithm
provider.get(SHA512)
```

## Using in your projects

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("dev.whyoleg.cryptography:cryptography-provider-jdk:0.2.0")
}
```
