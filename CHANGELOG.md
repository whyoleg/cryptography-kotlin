# CHANGELOG

## Unreleased

### ASN.1/DER

- RFC 8410 compliance: Ed25519/Ed448/X25519/X448 AlgorithmIdentifier encodes with ABSENT parameters; decoder tolerates explicit NULL.
- Unknown AlgorithmIdentifier parameters are preserved as raw ASN.1 for round-trip via new `Asn1Any` type.
- Support SEQUENCE OF (list) encode/decode in DER codec.

#### Breaking changes

- `UnknownKeyAlgorithmIdentifier` now carries `parameters: Any?` (previously always `null`) and the constructor signature changed to
  `UnknownKeyAlgorithmIdentifier(algorithm: ObjectIdentifier, parameters: Any? = null)`. This is an ABI change in
  `cryptography-serialization-asn1-modules`. Source usage that previously constructed the class with a single
  `algorithm` argument remains valid.

#### Other improvements

- AlgorithmIdentifier base deserializer now permits an ABSENT-parameters path (subclass constructs the value without consuming
  a parameters element), improving compatibility with inputs that omit parameters.
